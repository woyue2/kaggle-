[Verse 1:Hueningkai,Beomgyu]
We've been together ever since we were kids
A bird that had not seen for a while
My key is covered with my little
Low voice

[Verse 2: Soobin&Taehyun]
I feel awkward from head to toe
It's as awkward as a grown-up height
To you
Dear friend
You're acting like a real man

[Chorus:Hueningkai,Yeonjunjun,Beomgyu,Taehyun&Soobin]
Every night without a sound
I Grow taller and feel for you
I think he grew up on the right foot
My heart to see you
My heart

It's not what it used to be
My grown up heart
By one ́s own hand
We're ahead
As far away as one can go
You don't know
That We're 20cm apart
